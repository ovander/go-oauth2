## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Identity / KMS:** Introduced a `Signer` interface in `internal/shared/auth`
  that abstracts the JWT signing operation, with a default `localSigner`
  (in-process RSA key via `KeyManager`) and a `NewTokenServiceWithSigner`
  injection constructor. This is the "adapters before replacements" seam that
  lets a future KMS/HSM-backed signer be substituted without changing any
  token-generation code. Behaviour is unchanged (RS256 + `kid` header).
  _Traceability: capability C3 → EPIC-3 → RFC-002 → #6._
